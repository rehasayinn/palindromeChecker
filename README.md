# palindromeChecker
A console program that checks if the given string is a palindrome or not.

In this function, we are checking if the given sentence is a palindrome. To do that we create two variables the check both from the start and the end. After we create these two variables, a while loop is created to do the checking. In this while loop, there are two while loops that check if there are non-alphabetical characters. After those characters are skipped, then the two characters are compared to each other. If one single difference is seen, the function returns false. If not, the function returns true.
